# Personal Portfolio Website

Hi there! Thank you for visiting my personal portfolio website!

## How to Run

The site should be live at

## Functionality

This is the repo for my personal website. Here, users can see my contact info, previous work, projects, and skills.
This is a great for helping people to get to know me and also allows me to showcase my web dev skills.

## Tools used

This is a React Application, so I used React JS, HTML, and CSS. A specific library that became very useful to me was the react-reveal library, which made it incredibly easy to implement some really cool transitions on some of the website's components. I'm super glad I found out about this library!
